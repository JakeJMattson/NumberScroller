Send key events based on mouse wheel scrolling. This program was made specifically for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark:_Survival_Evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, 
but can be adapted for other games. Ark requires you to press individual number keys 
in order to access your hotbar items instead of allowing you to scroll between them.
By using this code, you can navigate using scrolling instead.
